# Sandbox lifecycle REST API

This document is the Frontend-owned reference for the sandbox lifecycle HTTP
surface. It describes the HTTP contract implemented by the Frontend; snapshot
catalog state, checkpoint bytes, and scheduler decisions are owned by the
downstream services.

All ordinary responses use the Frontend response envelope:

```json
{"code": 200, "message": "", "data": "<base64-encoded JSON>"}
```

`data` is the base64 encoding produced by Go's JSON encoding of the operation
result. The response examples below show the decoded JSON value of `data`.
SSE create responses are an exception and are described below.

## Routes

| Operation | Method and path | Request body | Decoded successful `data` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Create sandbox | `POST /api/sandbox/v1/sandboxes` | create fields, including optional `snapshotId` and `failover` | `{"sandboxId":"default-name","instanceId":"default-name","status":"running","requestId":"..."}`; `tunnel` is included when requested |
| Create reusable snapshot | `POST /api/sandbox/v1/sandboxes/{sandboxID}/snapshots` | `{"name":"optional","timeoutSeconds":300}` | `{"snapshotId":"...","names":["optional"]}` |
| Get reusable snapshot | `GET /api/sandbox/v1/snapshots/{snapshotID}` | none | tenant-scoped catalog JSON returned by the active Function Master |
| List reusable snapshots | `GET /api/sandbox/v1/snapshots?name=&pageToken=&pageSize=` | none | tenant-scoped catalog JSON returned by the active Function Master |
| Delete reusable snapshot | `DELETE /api/sandbox/v1/snapshots/{snapshotID}` | none | tenant-scoped catalog JSON returned by the active Function Master |
| Pause | `POST /api/sandbox/v1/sandboxes/{sandboxID}/pause` | `{"ttlSeconds":90000,"timeoutSeconds":300}` | `{"sandboxId":"...","snapshotId":"...","size":8192,"state":"paused","expiresAt":...}` |
| Resume | `POST /api/sandbox/v1/sandboxes/{sandboxID}/resume` | none | `{"sandboxId":"...","state":"running","routeAddress":"host:port","functionProxyId":"...","nodeId":"...","portMappings":{"8080":41080}}` |
| Reload | `POST /api/sandbox/v1/sandboxes/{sandboxID}/reload` | none | `{"success":true}` |

`snapshotId` on the normal create route creates a new sandbox from a reusable
snapshot. The snapshot is reusable; creating from it does not consume it.
The downstream snapshot resolver decides whether the snapshot is READY and
whether its function and resource type are compatible with the new request.
It then applies the source template's create options. The current resolver does
not independently validate every source/target reverse-tunnel mismatch, so a
caller requesting a tunnel must use a source template with the same tunnel
shape; otherwise the returned route may not correspond to a provisioned
tunnel.

Create uses the ordinary `X-Request-Id` header. It is optional: when absent,
Frontend derives the request ID from the trace ID, echoes it as `X-Request-Id`,
and includes it in the create result. This is distinct from the required
`X-YR-Request-ID` header used by the lifecycle routes below.

## Create from a reusable snapshot

Use the normal create route with a non-empty `snapshotId`. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "clone",
  "namespace": "default",
  "snapshotId": "snap-ready",
  "failover": false
}
```

`createTimeoutSeconds` and `scheduleTimeoutSeconds` are optional create
budgets. When supplied, Frontend validates their relationship and forwards the
resolved create budget and scheduling budget to the invocation; a create that
does not reach RUNNING before its create budget finishes is an ordinary-HTTP
`500` or an SSE final event with `status: "timeout"`. They are separate from
the Snapshot/Pause logical checkpoint timeout and SDK transport buffer
described below.

For a snapshot create, positive `cpu` or `memory` values override the template.
Omitted, zero, and `null` values preserve template inheritance: `null`
unmarshals to the Go zero value and follows the same non-positive-resource path
as `0`. This special handling applies only when `snapshotId` is non-empty; a
normal create retains the usual Frontend resource defaults.

The scheduler may select a fresh target for a create from a reusable snapshot
or for resume. Neither operation is pinned to the source node. By contrast,
reload and failover are same-node local-recovery operations, not reusable or
cross-node restore operations. They restore the latest local recovery
candidate and require it to exist. The selector filters
`localRecoveryCandidate`; internal checkpoints and Pause-created artifacts can
both carry that flag, with no separate internal-only discriminator. A missing
candidate, local-snapshot query failure, invalid metadata, or restore/deploy
failure is an error; neither operation has an alternate recovery path.

`failover` is a boolean create/configuration option that enables automatic
same-node recovery after a qualifying sandbox failure. It is **not** an HTTP
lifecycle operation: there is no `/failover` endpoint to call.

## Reusable snapshots

Creating a reusable snapshot leaves its source sandbox running and requests a
non-expiring snapshot. `name` is optional on raw HTTP; it may be absent or the
empty string, but a supplied whitespace-only name is rejected. The resulting
snapshot belongs to the tenant selected from `X-YR-Tenant-ID` (or compatible
`tenantId`), the authenticated tenant claim, or `default`.

Raw `timeoutSeconds` is honored for reusable snapshots and pause: it defaults
to 300 and must be from 1 through 3600 when supplied. Frontend passes it as
the checkpoint timeout and the direct-proxy lifecycle timeout. Pause also
accepts `ttlSeconds`; omitted or zero becomes 90000 and only a negative value
is rejected. Snapshot and Pause are currently the only lifecycle bodies with a
caller-provided logical timeout; SDK HTTP transport waits use that logical
value plus a 30-second buffer. Reusable Snapshot uses one SDK transport
attempt, while Pause uses the lifecycle retry policy.

The SDK generates a fresh reusable-Snapshot request ID for each call. Raw HTTP
clients retrying an uncertain result must reuse an ID only for the same source
and name; they must not reuse one identity for different catalog content.

The get/list/delete routes proxy that tenant-scoped catalog to the active
Function Master. List accepts the optional `name`, `pageToken`, and `pageSize`
query parameters. Delete requires a non-empty `X-YR-Request-ID`, which is
forwarded to the catalog operation.

## Lifecycle request IDs, errors, and retry

The lifecycle routes require a caller-supplied `X-YR-Request-ID` whose prefix
matches the operation. The complete accepted forms are:

```text
pause-[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,127}
resume-[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,127}
reload-[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,127}
snapshot-[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,127}
```

More precisely, the character immediately after the prefix must be
alphanumeric and the remaining suffix may use alphanumerics, `.`, `_`, or
`-`. These are header formats, not proof that a caller is the SDK. Raw HTTP
callers may supply a matching value. Pause additionally requires that its
returned `snapshotId` match that header value.

Create replay is separate from lifecycle IDs: it keys a request on tenant plus
`X-Request-Id` and compares the decoded create request. A changed decoded
request under that identity conflicts, as does a named create already in
flight under another identity. JSON omission, `0`, and `null` can normalize to
the same decoded scalar value, so raw clients must not reuse an ID for a
different request shape. The cache is an HTTP create boundary, not a guarantee
about an unknown network outcome outside Frontend.

For pause, resume, reload, and snapshot creation, malformed or missing
lifecycle IDs and invalid local input map to `400`; downstream business
rejection maps to `409`; Frontend-to-proxy transport failure maps to `503`; and
malformed/invalid authoritative response data maps to `500`. Reload retains
its `{"success":false}` decoded data on an error response. A `503`, a gateway
failure, or a lost connection can be an unknown result: retry only with the
same request ID and then query the authoritative lifecycle or catalog state.
Do not blindly issue a new lifecycle identity for an uncertain operation.

SDK behavior is deliberately not identical to raw HTTP behavior:

- `Sandbox.create_snapshot(name=None, timeout_seconds=300)` rejects blank names
  and validates an integral timeout from 1 through 3600. It sends
  `timeoutSeconds` and makes one HTTP attempt with that configured timeout plus
  a 30-second buffer; raw HTTP forwards that field to the checkpoint and
  direct-proxy lifecycle timeouts. The SDK treats gateway/connection failure
  while creating a reusable snapshot as uncertain and does not silently retry
  it.
- `Sandbox.pause(ttl_seconds=90000, *, timeout_seconds=300)` rejects zero,
  negative, and boolean TTLs and validates its keyword-only timeout from 1
  through 3600. Raw HTTP treats an omitted or zero `ttlSeconds` as `90000`,
  rejects only a negative value, and forwards `timeoutSeconds` as the
  checkpoint/direct-proxy lifecycle timeout. The SDK request timeout is the
  configured timeout plus 30 seconds.
- Pause, resume, and reload use up to three SDK HTTP attempts for retryable
  transport/gateway failures, retaining one `pause-`, `resume-`, or `reload-`
  identity across those attempts. Reusable snapshot creation is the single,
  uncertain-result attempt above. `reload()` returns `false` for a closed
  sandbox or `SandboxError`; callers needing the HTTP status and error message
  should use the REST response.

## Create HTTP versus SSE

`POST /api/sandbox/v1/sandboxes` returns the ordinary JSON envelope unless its
`Accept` header includes `text/event-stream`. Syntactic/bind failures that
occur while Frontend reads and prepares the request—such as malformed JSON, an
oversized body, or invalid pre-stream create fields—receive a normal HTTP
error, not an `accepted` SSE event.

Once a valid SSE create has begun, the HTTP status is `200` and the stream
contains an `accepted` event with `{"status":"creating","requestId":"..."}`,
periodic `: heartbeat` comments, and a `final` event. The final event carries
the same create fields as the non-SSE result, with status `running`, `timeout`,
or `failed`; errors add `errorCode` and `message`. Downstream invocation,
create-timeout handling, replay/identity checks, and business failures happen
after `accepted` and are reported by that final event. After `accepted`, the
final event—not a later HTTP status—is the completion boundary.

## Pause, resume, reload, and routing

Pause succeeds only with an authoritative non-empty snapshot ID equal to its
request ID and a positive snapshot size. Its response reports `state: "paused"`
and an `expiresAt` calculated from the effective TTL.

Resume succeeds only with an authoritative result for the requested sandbox
that includes a route address and function-proxy ID. Its returned route and
port mappings identify the selected target. SandboxRouter route-cache
convergence happens separately through its watch/read-through path; local route
publication is explicitly outside the resume success boundary.

Reload sends the local-recovery request and reports only success or failure.
It restores only from an existing latest local recovery candidate.
Missing candidates and query, metadata, or restore failures remain failures;
reload has no alternate recovery path. Reload is distinct from reusable
snapshot restore and from automatic failover.
